1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
but better having seen all that of course that's the case in

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,200
their minds they're The Underdogs and that's how they justify

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,099
this I'm not responsible for every fucked up Rick out there

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:16,000
literally all say that they all have that excuse it's part of their

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,899
system none of them have to be responsible they're all victims of

6
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,899
themselves oh it's so hard to be a genius couldn't you

7
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,500
just die what are you doing about it jack shit I'm

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,899
leaving you know what the central finite curve is they built a wall

9
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,800
around Infinity we separated all the infinite universes

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,500
from all the infinite universes where he's the smartest man in the

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,399
universe every version of us has been every version of all of

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,299
our lives and one infinite crib built around an infinite

13
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,600
fucking baby b-but I'm leaving it that's what makes me

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,899
evil being sick of him if you've ever been sick of them

15
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,500
you've been evil to Rick you really leave the crows for

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,399
me or did you come back because they dumped you there you go

17
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,700

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,100
all are on this side of the Curve
